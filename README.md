# Annotated-Transformer-English-to-Chinese-Translator

The Transformer from “Attention is All You Need” has been on a lot of people’s minds since 2017.

In this repo, I present an "annotated" version of the Transformer Paper in the form of a line-by-line implementation to build an English-to-Chinese translator with PyTorth deep learning framework.
